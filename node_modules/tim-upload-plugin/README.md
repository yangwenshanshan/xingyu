```

```javascript
import TencentCloudChat from '@tencentcloud/chat';
import TIMUploadPlugin from 'tim-upload-plugin';

let options = {
  SDKAppID: 0 // Replace 0 with the SDKAppID of your Chat application when connecting.
};
// Create an SDK instance.
// The `TencentCloudChat.create()` method returns the same instance for the same `SDKAppID`.
// The SDK instance is usually represented by chat.
let chat = TencentCloudChat.create(options);

// Set the SDK log level.
// 0: Common level. You are advised to use this level during access as it covers more logs.
// 1: Release level. You are advised to use this level for key information in a production environment.
chat.setLogLevel(0);
// chat.setLogLevel(1);

// Register the Tencent Cloud Chat upload plugin.
chat.registerPlugin({'tim-upload-plugin': TIMUploadPlugin});
